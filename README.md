StudyMate AI – RAG-Powered Learning Assistant

This project presents the concept of an AI-powered study companion for university students that transforms everything a student learns into organized, useful knowledge.

At the beginning of a semester, students add their courses to the system. For each course, they can upload lecture materials such as PDFs, PowerPoint slides, or documents, or attend live lectures. The system processes both uploaded files and live lecture content.

Instead of storing raw text, the system understands the meaning of the content and saves it as structured knowledge inside an AI memory. This allows students to interact with their learning materials in a smarter way.

Students can:

Ask questions about their courses

Get simple summaries of complex topics

See highlighted key concepts for exams

Reuse stored knowledge throughout the semester

Vision

The main goal of the system is to reduce study overload and help students focus on what truly matters, without rewriting notes or relying on blind memorization.
